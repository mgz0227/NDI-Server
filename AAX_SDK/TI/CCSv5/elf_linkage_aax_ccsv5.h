/*
The __binit__ section stores data that that needs to be copied at load-time. Plug-ins don't use it, but since our plug-ins are actually dynamic executables rather than dynamic libraries, we need to have the initialization functions just like a static executable ï¿½ this is why we link to the RTS library and export the auto_init_elf function. But because we link to RTS, we need to handle __binit__.
